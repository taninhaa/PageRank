# PageRank

#### Introduction 
Our project was based on calculating the PageRank of Wikipedia pages in order to create a usefull tool that everyone can use.  
Actually, we have created a tool you can use on **your terminal** to search informations on a word.  
In this repository gitHub, you have access to **our codes to calculate the _PageRank_** with different methods.  
You also have access to the **bash script** we have made for our tool as well as **a report** we have made in french to explain our approach.

If you want to see our work and use our tool on your computer, follow the instructions below: 

#### Importation on your computer 

* Create a folder and open it from the terminal. 

* Then, use the command:

`git clone https://github.com/taninhaa/PageRank.git`

Once you have our project on your local repository, you can use our command **_wiki_**. 

#### Access to the command _wiki_

Open a terminal on you computer by using `Ctrl + Alt + T`. 
Change the directory until you get to the PageRank on your computer by using the command `cd`.  
You can now acess to the _wiki_ command by following:

`chmod 755 wiki_search.sh`
or  
`chmod +x wiki_search.sh`

Then, use:
`./wiki_search "word"`. Here, "word" is the word you decide to search. 

 ##### Let's make an example:
 We decide to search informations on the word "Hello". 
 
 `chmod 755 wiki_search.sh` or `chmod +x wiki_search.sh`
 
Then, 
`./wiki_search Hello`

We have the following result:
